mapred_verify is a command line tool to verify the sanity of Riak's MapReduce API.
mapred_verify currently uses Riak's native Erlang interface which means you need
to have a source checkout of Riak built and locally available.

*** Building mapred_verify ***
make (Yes, that's all there is to it)

*** Using mapred_verify ****
Running mapred_verify is pretty simple. Tell the tool the Erlang node name of the
server to test and the path to the top level of the checked out Riak source and
mapred_verify will do the rest.

For example, if you wanted to test a server named riak@127.0.0.1 and your Riak
source checkout lived in /Users/foo/projects/riak you'd invoke mapred_verify
like this:

./mapred_verify -s riak@127.0.0.1 -c /Users/foo/projects/riak



*** Interpreting results ***
mapred_verify runs several combinations of MapReduce jobs using Erlang and
Javascript. It executes each job against a full bucket and a discrete set
of inputs to verify the jobs work in both use cases. Finally mapred_verify
also validates the results to insure the job is returning the correct values.

A successful mapred_verify run looks like this:

./mapred_verify -s riak@192.168.1.106 -c /repos/basho/riak
